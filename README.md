# Sukeruton
Responsive and fluid structure for Web Projects (in permanent development)
Sukeruton was created by me as an attempt of a formal boilerplate for projects, starting on Wecan studio site and portfolio.

Feel free to get a copy, use as you want and if you feel like, suggest, criticize, comment.

Kind regards.
